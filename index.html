        <h2>Welcome to Dane's Story</h2>
        <p>
          This website is dedicated to sharing the story of Dane Minnick, someone who balances
          hard work, family, and fun. Dane is currently working through his electrician
          apprenticeship, a path inspired by watching his dad work with his hands and fix just
          about anything. His journey blends learning a skilled trade with planning for a future
          that lets him support himself while still making time for the people and activities he loves.

          Dane is currently in an electrician apprenticeship program. He enjoys learning how
          things are wired, troubleshooting problems, and working alongside his dad on projects.
          This hands-on work fits his personality and gives him a foundation for a stable career.

          Outside of work, Dane is a big Chicago Cubs fan and loves traveling to new places.
          He has already visited many states and hopes to see all fifty one day. You can often
          find him tailgating before concerts, grilling food, and spending time with friends.
