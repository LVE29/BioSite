      <h2>Welcome to Dane's Story</h2>
      <p>
        This website is dedicated to sharing the story of Dane Minnick, someone who balances hard work,
        family, and fun. Dane is currently working through his electrician apprenticeship, a path inspired
        by watching his dad work with his hands and fix just about anything. His journey blends learning a
        skilled trade with planning for a future that lets him support himself while still making time for
        the people and activities he loves.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he is not working, Dane enjoys a mix of sports, travel, and time outdoors. He is a dedicated
        Chicago Cubs fan and loves watching baseball with friends and family. Traveling to new places is
        also a big part of his life. He has already visited many states and hopes to see all fifty one day.
        Many of his trips include concerts where he can tailgate before the show, combining his love of
        music, grilling, and hanging out with friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site will grow over time to highlight different sides of Dane’s life, including his work on
        the family farm, his cookout competition win, and the hobbies that keep him motivated. Each page
        will use photos, color, and layout choices that reflect his personality and interests.
