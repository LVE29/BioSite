        <h2>Dane’s Hobbies</h2>

        <p>
          Dane’s hobbies reflect the things he values most outside of work: spending time with friends
          and family, trying new experiences, and making memories along the way. One of his favorite
          hobbies is grilling, especially when he can cook steaks or meals for others. Grilling gives
          him a creative outlet and a chance to slow down and focus on the details that make food taste
          great. Whether it is a casual dinner at home or a larger cookout, he enjoys bringing people
          together through food.
        </p>

        <p>
          Traveling is another hobby that means a lot to Dane. He enjoys taking road trips and exploring
          new places, and he has set a personal goal of visiting all fifty states. Each trip adds to his
          collection of memories and experiences, and he even keeps state magnets as reminders of where
          he has been. Dane also enjoys attending baseball games, concerts, and tailgating with friends.
          These hobbies help him relax, recharge, and maintain a healthy balance between work and life.
