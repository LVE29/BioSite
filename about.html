        <h2>About Dane</h2>

        <p>
          Dane is someone who values hard work, loyalty, and steady progress. He is currently
          completing an electrician apprenticeship, a path that makes sense for him because he enjoys
          hands on learning and practical problem solving. A big influence in his life has been his dad,
          who taught him the importance of learning skills that are useful in the real world and taking
          pride in doing a job the right way. Over time, Dane has grown into someone who is dependable,
          focused, and willing to put in the effort to build a strong future.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of work, Dane stays busy with the things that matter most to him: family, friends, and
          experiences. He is a dedicated sports fan, especially when it comes to baseball. His favorite team is
          the Chicago Cubs. Whether he is watching a game at home or going in person, sports are one of the ways he
          relaxes and connects with others. He also enjoys traveling and has set a personal goal of visiting
          all fifty states. He has already made strong progress toward that goal and keeps a growing
          collection of state magnets as a reminder of each trip.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dane also enjoys grilling and smoking meats. It is a hobby that lets him be creative while also
          bringing people together. He has even won a cookout competition, which is one of the accomplishments
          he is most proud of because it came from practice and paying attention to details. When he is not
          working, traveling, or cooking, he and his dad also spend time improving their family farm, doing
          renovations and planning future projects. Overall, Dane’s story is about building a stable life,
          staying connected to the people he cares about, and making time for hobbies that keep life fun.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking ahead, Dane hopes to continue growing both personally and professionally. He wants to
          complete his apprenticeship, gain more experience in his trade, and keep building a life that
          balances responsibility with enjoyment. His long-term goals reflect his focus on stability,
          independence, and staying true to the values he was raised with.
